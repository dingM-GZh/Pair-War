# Pair War
CS 4328 - Operating Systems (Programming Assignment 2)
Fall 2019 - Dr. J. M. Palacios

## Execution
To create the executable, run the command `g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Player.h -lpthread`.
Then run the command `./a.out`.

The results will be stored in a file called `pair_war.log`. The file can be opened with any text editor. The `.log` extension does not matter.

**NOTE: The final build is UNSTABLE. While the program can execute to completion, it may require a few executions. If the `a.out` is executed and nothing happens, then the program crashed. Please make another attempt. It should not take more than 3 tries.**
