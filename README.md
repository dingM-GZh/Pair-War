# Pair War
CS 4328 - Operating Systems (Programming Assignment 2)
Fall 2019 - Dr. J. M. Palacios

## Execution
To create the executable, run the command `g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Player.h -lpthread`.
Then run the command `./a.out`.

The results will be stored in a file called `pair_war.log`. The file can be opened with any text editor. The `.log` extension does not matter.

**NOTE: The final build is UNSTABLE. While the program can execute to completion, it may require a few executions. If the `a.out` is executed and nothing happens, then the program crashed. Please make another attempt. It should not take more than 3 tries.**

## Log Files
The log files made by final program are listed `pair_war_#.log`, where `#` can be replaced by any integer from 1 to 5. The seeds of each log file are, respectively:
> 20, 11, 100, 5912, 583

The `pair_war.log` has a seed of 12.
